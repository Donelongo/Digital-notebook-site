Our project topic will be  a Digital Notebook.
The Digital Notebook platform serves as a centralized repository enabling companies and their employees to collectively store and access notes within a unified interface. This solution facilitates seamless collaboration by allowing an administrator to oversee and manage all aspects, while providing controlled permissions for staff members.
